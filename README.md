# DL4YHF-Frequency-Meter

Modified version of the excellent, PIC Micro-based frequency meter by Wolfgang "Wolf" BÃ¼scher, DL4YHF

Added option to specify that you are using an external crystal oscillator module on OSC1, which frees OSC2/RA6/PB6 as an output pin that can then be used to control display digit 5 instead of the diode/transistor NAND gate.
